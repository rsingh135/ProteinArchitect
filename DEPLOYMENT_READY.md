# ✅ Deployment Ready!

## What We Did

1. ✅ **Pulled remote changes** - Got latest code from your team (9 commits)
2. ✅ **Applied your Vercel fixes** - No conflicts!
3. ✅ **Committed changes** - Ready to push

## Files Changed

- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration (builds from `frontend/` directory)
- `frontend/vite.config.js` - Added build/resolve options for module resolution
- `frontend/.vercelignore` - Ignore unnecessary files during deployment
- `.gitignore` - Updated comments

## Next Step: Push to Deploy

```bash
git push origin main
```

After pushing:
- ✅ Vercel will automatically deploy (if GitHub integration is set up)
- ✅ Build should complete successfully
- ✅ zustand import error should be fixed

## What Changed from Remote

Your team added:
- New backend services (AgenticResearch.py)
- New frontend components (VoiceAssistant, InteractionViewer, etc.)
- New utilities (molecularDynamics, proteinContextBuilder)
- Moved bioDesignModel to backend/services
- Updated package.json dependencies

Your Vercel fixes are now on top of all these changes! 🎉

## Verify Deployment

After pushing, check:
1. Vercel dashboard - Build should succeed
2. No zustand import errors
3. Application loads correctly

Good luck! 🚀
